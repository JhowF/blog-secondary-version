The project was built to improve my skills on HTTP requests. As usual, I used gitflow to organize the project's branches and Axios to help with HTTP requests. During development, I was able to explore several new features, such as modals, login and conditional rendering. To improve the fluidity of the application, use the lazy loading feature. In addition, I made extensive use of useContext to distribute access to components and ensure application stickiness. It is worth noting that the code is responsive and all features have been tested and work perfectly on mobile devices.
